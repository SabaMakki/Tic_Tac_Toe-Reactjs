# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Hello, welcome to my Tic Tac Toe project

In order to be able to work with React JS, it is necessary to check and install some items.

# First Step: install node js

You can run the following command in the cmd or terminal to find out if you have Node JS installed on your system.

### `node --version`

If the command was unknown to the system, you must install Node.
You can download it from the link below :
(https://nodejs.org/en/)
Then run the above command again to make sure it is installed. you can also do the same for npm :

### `npm --version`

# Second Step : use vs code

you should have Visual Studio Code to work with react so easily.
You can download it from the link below :
(https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

# Third Step : clone from github

make a folder you want to put the react project from github in it.

1- In Vs code, open the terminal(ctrl+`) and run this commands :

### `git clone {the url to the GitHub repo}`

This clones the repository from github.

2- Go into the new folder :

### `cd {myfolder}`

3- then run this command :

### `npm install`

This installs the required dependencies.

4-To run the React project.

### `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
